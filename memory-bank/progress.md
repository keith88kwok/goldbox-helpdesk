- **Better Error Handling**: Specific error messages for different authentication scenarios
- **User Experience**: Seamless transition between login and password setup steps

### Recent Fixes
- ✅ **Multi-Step Authentication**: Resolved `CONFIRM_SIGN_IN_WITH_NEW_PASSWORD_REQUIRED` flow
- ✅ **User Creation**: Admin user invitation system working correctly
- ✅ **Password Validation**: Added proper password strength requirements
- ✅ **WorkspaceUser Data Fix**: Added missing createdAt/updatedAt fields to invite function
- ✅ **User Profile Loading**: Resolved "User profile not found" error
- ✅ **Complete Auth Flow**: Login → Password Change → Dashboard working end-to-end

## Known Issues and Risks

### Current Issues
- No known issues with current authentication implementation

### Recent Fixes
- ✅ **Multi-Step Authentication**: Resolved `CONFIRM_SIGN_IN_WITH_NEW_PASSWORD_REQUIRED` flow
- ✅ **User Creation**: Admin user invitation system working correctly
- ✅ **Password Validation**: Added proper password strength requirements

### Potential Risks
1. **DynamoDB Design Complexity**: Single-table design may require careful planning
2. **Workspace Isolation**: Must ensure no data leakage between workspaces
3. **File Upload Handling**: Large file uploads may require special handling
4. **SSR Performance**: Server-side rendering requirements may impact performance

### Risk Mitigation Strategies
1. **Database Design**: Start with simple multi-table approach, optimize later if needed
2. **Access Control**: Implement workspace filtering at the query level
3. **File Handling**: Use S3 direct upload with signed URLs
4. **Performance**: Implement proper caching and optimization strategies
