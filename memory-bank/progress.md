## Known Issues and Risks

### Current Issues
- No known critical issues with current implementation
- Minor: Some unused parameters cleaned up in recent ESLint fixes

### Recent Fixes
- ✅ **Ticket Edit Type Safety**: Fixed status enum casting and datetime formatting
- ✅ **Navigation Consistency**: Seamless navigation between ticket views
- ✅ **Form Pre-population**: Proper data formatting for edit forms
- ✅ **ESLint Cleanup**: Removed unused variables and imports

### Potential Risks
1. **File Upload Scale**: Large file uploads may require chunking for attachments
2. **Comment Threading**: Complex comment structures may impact performance
3. **Real-time Updates**: Comment notifications may require WebSocket implementation
4. **Export Performance**: Large dataset exports may need background processing

### Risk Mitigation Strategies
1. **File Handling**: Implement progressive upload with S3 direct upload
2. **Comment Design**: Start with simple linear comments, expand later
3. **Real-time**: Use polling initially, consider WebSockets for v2
4. **Export Optimization**: Implement pagination and background jobs
