## Phase-by-Phase Implementation Details

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Week 1)
**Backend Schema Implementation**
```typescript
// amplify/data/resource.ts
export const schema = a.schema({
  User: a.model({...}).authorization([a.allow.owner()]),
  Workspace: a.model({...}).authorization([a.allow.authenticated()]),
  WorkspaceUser: a.model({...}).authorization([a.allow.authenticated()]),
  Kiosk: a.model({...}).authorization([a.allow.authenticated()]),
  Ticket: a.model({...}).authorization([a.allow.authenticated()]),
});
```

**Client Setup**
```typescript
// lib/amplify-client.ts
import { generateClient } from 'aws-amplify/data';
import { type Schema } from '@/amplify/data/resource';
export const client = generateClient<Schema>();
```

### Phase 2: Core Features (Week 2)
**Workspace Filtering Pattern**
```typescript
// Get workspace kiosks
const { data: kiosks } = await client.models.Kiosk.list({
  filter: { workspaceId: { eq: currentWorkspaceId } }
});
```

### Phase 3: Ticket System (Week 3)
**Real-time Updates**
```typescript
// Real-time ticket updates
useEffect(() => {
  const sub = client.models.Ticket.observeQuery({
    filter: { workspaceId: { eq: currentWorkspaceId } }
  }).subscribe({
    next: ({ items, isSynced }) => setTickets([...items]),
  });
  return () => sub.unsubscribe();
}, [currentWorkspaceId]);
```

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Week 4)
**Pagination & Export**
```typescript
// Paginated data for export
const { data: tickets, nextToken } = await client.models.Ticket.list({
  filter: { workspaceId: { eq: currentWorkspaceId } },
  limit: 1000,
  nextToken: previousToken
});
```
