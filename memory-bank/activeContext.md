# Active Context: Kiosk Maintenance Helpdesk

## Current Focus: Amplify Gen 2 Field Naming Convention Fixes

**CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED**: Fundamental confusion between Amplify auto-generated `id` fields and custom business ID fields throughout the codebase.

### Root Cause Analysis
- **Problem**: Mixed usage of `Workspace.id` vs `Workspace.workspaceId` in URLs, relationships, and database operations
- **Impact**: Data inconsistency errors, failed workspace switching, routing problems
- **Scope**: Affects ALL models (User, Workspace, Kiosk, Ticket, WorkspaceUser)

### Current Status: FIXING FIELD NAMING CONVENTIONS

#### âœ… Completed:
1. **Memory Bank Updated**: Documented correct field usage patterns in techContext.md
2. **switchWorkspace Function**: Added fallback logic to handle both id and workspaceId
3. **RouteGuard**: Improved workspace access validation
4. **URL Structure Fixed**: Renamed `/workspace/[workspaceId]` to `/workspace/[id]`
5. **Landing Page Created**: Converted root route to proper landing page
6. **Cleanup Completed**: Removed unused `/dashboard` folder

#### ðŸ”„ In Progress:
1. ~~URL/Path Naming~~: âœ… Completed - All routes now use Amplify `id` consistently
2. **Database References**: Verify all model relationships use correct `id` fields
3. **Component Updates**: Fix any components using wrong field references

#### ðŸ“‹ Next Steps:
1. **Audit all file paths**: Rename `[workspaceId]` to `[id]` in route parameters
2. **Review all database operations**: Ensure using `client.models.Model.get({ id: amplifyId })`
3. **Fix relationship queries**: Ensure WorkspaceUser.workspaceId references Workspace.id
4. **Update component props**: Change workspaceId props to id where referring to Amplify IDs
5. **Consistent naming**: Use `workspaceId` only for custom business identifier, `id` for Amplify primary key

### Critical Rules Established:
- **URLs**: Always use Amplify `id` â†’ `/workspace/[id]/dashboard`
- **Relationships**: Always reference Amplify `id` fields
- **Database Ops**: Use `.get({ id })` for single record lookup
- **Custom IDs**: Use for business logic only, never for database operations

## Current Focus
**Workspace Management System COMPLETED** - Full workspace selection, creation, and navigation system implemented. Ready to move to kiosk management interface development.
