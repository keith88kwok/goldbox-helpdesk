# Active Context: Kiosk Maintenance Helpdesk

## Current Focus: 🎯 DASHBOARD STATISTICS IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE! 🎉

**MAJOR ACHIEVEMENT**: Dynamic dashboard statistics have been successfully implemented, replacing hardcoded values with real-time workspace data!

### ✅ COMPLETED: Dashboard Statistics Enhancement Phase

#### Dashboard Statistics Features ✅ **NEW!**
- **✅ Dashboard Utils Module** - Created `src/lib/server/dashboard-utils.ts` with aggregated statistics fetching
- **✅ WorkspaceStats Interface** - Typed interface for total kiosks, open tickets, and team members
- **✅ Server-Side Data Fetching** - Dashboard page now fetches real statistics server-side for performance
- **✅ Dynamic Statistics Display** - Client component displays actual counts instead of hardcoded values
- **✅ Parallel Data Fetching** - Uses Promise.all for optimal performance when loading multiple datasets
- **✅ Error Handling** - Graceful fallback to zeros if statistics fetching fails

#### Technical Implementation Details

##### Dashboard Statistics Module
- **`getWorkspaceStats()`** - Aggregates data from kiosks, tickets, and users
- **Performance Optimized** - Fetches all data in parallel using Promise.all
- **Error Resilient** - Returns zeros if data fetching fails to prevent dashboard breakage
- **Type Safe** - Full TypeScript support with WorkspaceStats interface

##### Real-Time Statistics
- **Total Kiosks** - Counts all kiosks in the workspace regardless of status
- **Open Tickets** - Counts tickets with 'OPEN' or 'IN_PROGRESS' status for actionable insights
- **Team Members** - Counts all users who have access to the workspace

##### Server-Side Integration
- **Dashboard Page** - Fetches workspace access and statistics in parallel server-side
- **Props Passing** - Statistics passed to client component as typed props
- **Performance** - Server-side calculation reduces client-side loading time
